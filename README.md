<p>This is a C program implementing the different ways computer systems use to negate numbers in binary using sign-magnitude, 1's compliment and 2's compliment.</p>
<p>The problem I faced in coding this program was with how to implement the visual representation, because in C we dont have a binary representaion.<br>
So I tried to use normal padding, string and inteager manipulations but none of them worked for me and all of them were a complete mess! , So I ended with using a diferent idea which was
using arrays!</p>
<p>By using arrays to store the 
binary input numbers and doing array items manipulations,we were able to do it and it was the easiest and the most elegent way i ended up with.</p>
<p>I am still continuing my journy with Neso Academy's course : "C Programming and Data Structer".</p>
<p>Hoping for the best &#128516;
